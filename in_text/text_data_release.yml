  Data release: Multi-source water temperature observations for U.S. streams

abstract: >-
  This data release collates stream water temperature records across the United States from four sources: 
  The National Water Information System (NWIS),  Water Quality Portal (WQP),  Spatial Hydro-Ecological Decision Systems (SHEDS)
  temperature database, and  NorWeST stream temperature database. Temperature monitoring sites were paired to stream
  segments from the National Geospatial Fabric. Data were reduced to daily mean, minimum, and maximum temperatures
  when sub-daily measurements were available. Quality control was conducted by flagging temperature observations that 
  were outside of three standard deviations of the mean of all temperature records in 1 by 1 degree areas and 6 day time chunks.

        Additionally, values may not always be an accurate representation of the number of 
        sub-daily observations, as original sources may not have provided this Information with 
        corresponding daily data.
